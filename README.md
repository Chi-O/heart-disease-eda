## Introduction:
This is our analysis of a dataset about patients that suffered from heart failure.

The dataset, which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction), is a combination of several datasets from America, Hungary, Switzerland and Germany and has a total of 918 records. The records include patient data such as sex, blood pressure and cholesterol for example, as well as whether the patient suffered from any heart disease.

In our analysis, we use the information in the dataset to try to answer questions about the frequency and effects of heart disease. We also look into the frequency and relationships of different causes of chest pain. 
We chose these questions in particular because they may represent causes of or ways to identify heart disease. Answers to these questions may help identify people with, or at risk of getting heart disease.
